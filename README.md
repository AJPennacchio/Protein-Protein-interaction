Directory:

STRING/ : contains known protein interactions of our sample proteins from STRING database + associated scripts

alphafold/ : protein-protein interactions tested in alphafold, and jsons for batch running alphafold

data/ : Ligand and receptor data, L/R pairs to test, and sequence database fasta file

models/ : Models used to predict PPIs. 

output/ : PPI predictions from model

scripts/ : scripts for data preprocessing, database construction, visualizing predictions

subcel_location/ : data about subcellular location of proteins, from uniprot and https://wlab.ethz.ch/cspa/
